;; Take two Rosette values (potentially structs, vectors, etc.) and return a list of pairs of Rosette terms from corresponding parts of the two structs
;; as well as a list of symbolic variables that appear free in skipped terms (we need this to do a check later).
;;
;; At a high level, the goal is to get rid of equal stuff so it doesn't make its way to the solver. But we have to be careful what we get rid of,
;; because it might break soundness if we do this wrong.
;;
;; This function is conservative and bails out on some stuff that's hard to analyze (e.g. unions; we don't rely on those).
;;
;; Returns false if one can't subsume another (e.g. due to type mismatch).
